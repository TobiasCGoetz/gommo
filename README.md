# GoMMO

This is a "massive multiplayer" implementation of a tabletop game I designed. Managing the physical board state becomes quite involved in the later rounds of the game. This should serve as a better basis to tweak the rules and offer online playtesting.

## Status

I'm currently heavily rewriting the internals of this project. Breakages are to be expected.
